# Floor Plan Generation from Tracked Physical Objects

This repo contains all files needed to build the HoloLens app and the Windows server allowing to experiment with our mixed reality floor plan generation system, as described in [our article](Reports/MR_Final_Poyet_Queinnec_Teissier_Yilmaz.pdf).
You would need to 3D-print the physical objects that are located [here](Models/1_20_furniture_for_tracking).

## Set up the project
To set up this project, please follow the instructions in the [README](FloorPlanGen_Unity/README.md) of the `FloorPlanGen_Unity` folder, and the [README](Server_Unity/README.md) of the `Server_Unity` folder.
